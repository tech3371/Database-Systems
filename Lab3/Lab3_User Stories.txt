User Stories:
1. As a user I want a price check gurantee (match lowest price) --- 1

2. As a engineer I want an easier way to collect data to know what products to buy --- 7

3. As a business owner some I want some sort of streamlined process for adding products to your site (Amazon has unreasonably 
high standards for vendors to sell) --- 5

4. As a user I want to have a trial period before actually buying an item --- 2

5. As a user I want within the hour shipping  --- 10

Explanations:

1. 3rd party sites can easily be incorporated.

2. Amazon is most likely very private with their data. Also, it would take a large amount of time to gather data
from users as well as mining that data.

3. Multi-step process of verfications that is very time/energy consuming.

4. Can possibly try products at a physical retail store and have finite amount of time.

5. Logistical nightname and incredibly demanding. Would require a fleet of drones and depending on where you're located,
it could take too long to reach the address.
